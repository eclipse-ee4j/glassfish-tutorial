9 Expression Language
---------------------


This chapter introduces the Expression Language (also referred to as the
EL), which provides an important mechanism for enabling the presentation
layer (web pages) to communicate with the application logic (managed
beans). The EL is used by several Jakarta EE technologies, such as
Jakarta Faces technology, Jakarta Server Pages technology, and
Dependency Injection for Jakarta EE (CDI). The EL can also be
used in stand-alone environments. This chapter only covers the use of
the EL in Jakarta EE containers.
