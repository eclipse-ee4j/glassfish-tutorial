Web Services Interoperability and Jakarta XML Web Services
-----------------------------------------------------------

Jakarta XML Web Services supports the Web Services Interoperability (WS-I) Basic Profile
Version 1.1. The WS-I Basic Profile is a document that clarifies the
SOAP 1.1 and WSDL 1.1 specifications to promote SOAP interoperability.
For links related to WS-I, see link:jaxws005.html#BNAZE[Further
Information about Jakarta XML Web Services].

To support WS-I Basic Profile Version 1.1, the Jakarta XML Web Services runtime supports
doc/literal and rpc/literal encodings for services, static ports,
dynamic proxies, and the Dynamic Invocation Interface (DII).
